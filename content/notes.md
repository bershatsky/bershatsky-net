Hugo uses markdown. Since I'm no expert, this page will act as a reference for future posts. Perhaps you'll find it useful as well.

## YouTube Shortcodes
I can't post the code here as Hugo will just embed the video, so here's the link to Hugo's website with the shortcode for YouTube.

The shortcode on Hugo's website doesn't work any more. The best solution now is to copy the embed code from Instagram proper. However, you can center the Instagram embed by using the following code:

```
